If you're working with Go Lang, the official [Benzinga Go SDK](https://github.com/benzinga) package is the easiest way to fetch and work with secrets for your application.

- [Package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/benzinga/go-sdk)
- [Github Repository](https://github.com/benzinga/go-sdk)

# Basic Usage

This example demonstrates how to use the Benzinga Go SDK in a simple Go application. The application retrieves a secret named `API_KEY` from the `dev` environment of the `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` project.

<Warning>
    We do not recommend hardcoding your [API Tokens](/platform/identities/overview). Setting it as an environment variable would be best.
</Warning>

# Installation

```console
$ go get github.com/benzinga/go-sdk
```
